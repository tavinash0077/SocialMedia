1. @JsonIgnore:
The @JsonIgnore annotation is used in bidirectional relationships (e.g., a User entity has a SocialProfile, and SocialProfile has a User reference) to prevent infinite recursion during JSON serialization.

Without @JsonIgnore, JSON serializers like Jackson may enter an infinite loop as they serialize both entities back and forth.
Example:

java
Copy code
public class User {
    @OneToOne(mappedBy = "user", cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
    private SocialProfile socialProfile;
}

public class SocialProfile {
    @JsonIgnore
    @OneToOne
    private User user;
}
This ensures that when serializing a SocialProfile, the User reference is ignored, preventing infinite nesting.

2. The Error: non-transient entity has a null id
This error indicates that Hibernate attempted to persist an entity (SocialProfile in this case) with a null identifier. Hibernate requires an entity to have a valid @Id (Primary Key) before it can be persisted.

3. Solution: Cascading Operations
Cascading allows you to propagate an operation (e.g., persist, remove) performed on one entity to its associated entities.

In your case, you want to save the SocialProfile automatically when saving the User.
What to Do:

Use the cascade attribute in the relationship annotation to specify cascading behavior.
Example with Cascading:

java
Copy code
@Entity
public class User {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    @OneToOne(mappedBy = "user", cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
    private SocialProfile socialProfile;

    public void setSocialProfile(SocialProfile socialProfile) {
        this.socialProfile = socialProfile;
        socialProfile.setUser(this); // Maintain bidirectional consistency
    }
}

@Entity
public class SocialProfile {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    @OneToOne
    private User user;
}
Now, when you save the User entity, Hibernate will automatically save the associated SocialProfile entity as well.

4. Cascading Operations Explained:
Cascading simplifies the management of related entities by automatically propagating actions such as:

PERSIST: Save the related entity when the parent entity is saved.
MERGE: Merge changes from the parent entity to the related entities.
REMOVE: Delete the related entities when the parent entity is deleted.
REFRESH: Refresh the state of related entities when the parent entity is refreshed.
ALL: Apply all cascading operations.



5.    {
          "id": 4,
          "socialProfile": null,
          "posts": [],
          "groups": []
      },

      we are getting social profile as null.
      And why is this custom setter needed.

      So the custom setter method in the user like social user entity is for setting the profile is important

      because it is maintaining.

      It is being used for maintaining the consistency on both the sides of the bidirectional relationship

      in the memory.

 => cascade = CascadeType.PERSIST =>> it handles the saving of entitiees, but it does not update the existing oncee
